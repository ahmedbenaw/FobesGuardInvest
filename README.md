# Product Requirments (PRD)

**Proposed PRD for Fraud Detection Dashboard**

**1. Metrics and Scoring Mechanism**

The Fraud Detection Dashboard will use a comprehensive scoring mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of founders based on the following dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Historical Fraud Cases**

Metrics:
- Number of previously listed founders associated with fraudulent companies (Quantitative)
- Types of fraud committed by these founders (Quantitative)
- Duration of fraudulent activities and the companies involved (Quantitative)
- Legal consequences and penalties faced by fraudulent founders (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights for each metric based on its importance in fraud detection (e.g., 0.2 for the number, 0.3 for types of fraud, 0.2 for the duration, and 0.3 for legal consequences).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on historical data (e.g., using Excel formula or Python script).
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 2: Background Checks**

Metrics:
- Detailed background checks on founders, including previous business ventures and roles (Qualitative)
- Verify educational qualifications and work experience (Qualitative)
- Investigate any discrepancies or inaccuracies in their provided information (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- The background checks will be qualitatively assessed by experts, assigning scores based on the level of thoroughness and completeness (e.g., 0 for incomplete, 50 for partially complete, and 100 for thorough).
- Discrepancies and inaccuracies will be quantitatively scored based on severity (e.g., 0 for no discrepancies, 50 for minor discrepancies, and 100 for major discrepancies).
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension based on the qualitative and quantitative data.

**Dimension 3: Regulatory Compliance**

Metrics:
- Assess the founders' compliance with industry regulations and legal requirements (Quantitative)
- Check for any regulatory violations or sanctions against the founders or their previous companies (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on the impact of regulatory compliance on trustworthiness (e.g., 0.5 for compliance and 0.5 for violations).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on historical data or regulatory records.
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 4: Industry Reputation**

Metrics:
- Analyze the reputation of the industries in which the founders have operated (Quantitative)
- Identify patterns of fraudulent activities specific to certain industries (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on the industry's impact on trustworthiness (e.g., 0.6 for reputation and 0.4 for fraud patterns).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on historical data and industry-specific information.
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 5: Financial Anomalies**

Metrics:
- Detect unusual financial patterns or discrepancies in the founders' financial statements (Quantitative)
- Look for evidence of inflating revenues, hiding debts, or misleading investors (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on the severity of financial anomalies (e.g., 0.4 for patterns and 0.6 for misleading practices).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on financial data and anomaly detection methods.
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 6: Corporate Governance**

Metrics:
- Evaluate the corporate governance structure of the founders' previous companies (Quantitative)
- Assess the effectiveness of internal controls and oversight mechanisms (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on their impact on trustworthiness (e.g., 0.6 for governance structure and 0.4 for internal controls).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on corporate governance assessments.
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 7: Media and Public Perception**

Metrics:
- Monitor media coverage and public perception of the founders and their businesses (Quantitative)
- Look for any discrepancies between public perception and the reality of the company's performance (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on their impact on trustworthiness (e.g., 0.5 for media coverage and 0.5 for perception discrepancies).
- Calculate the scores for each metric based on media analysis and sentiment analysis.
- Calculate the overall score for this dimension as the weighted sum of individual scores.

**Dimension 8: Whistleblower Reports**

Metrics:
- Investigate any past or current whistleblower reports related to the founders or their companies (Quantitative)
- Analyze the validity and credibility of these reports (Quantitative)

Scoring Mechanism:
- Assign weights to each metric based on their impact on trustworthiness (e.g., 0.6 for reports and 0.4 for credibility).

- Dashboard Design: Organize the data into user-friendly dashboards with an intuitive user interface. The dashboard should have clear sections for each dimension, displaying scores, red flags, and detailed profiles of founders.

- Real-time Data Update: Implement a mechanism to update the data and scores in real-time to ensure the latest information is available to users.

- Exporting Reports: Provide an option to export due diligence reports for founders of interest in downloadable formats (e.g., PDF, CSV). The report should include all relevant data points, metrics, and scores for the selected founder.

**4. Weightings and Score Ranges**

The weightings for each dimension are assigned based on their relative importance in the trustworthiness evaluation. They can be adjusted based on user feedback and historical performance of the dashboard.

- Historical Fraud Cases: Weight - 20%
